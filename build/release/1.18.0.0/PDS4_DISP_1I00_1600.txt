   Comment                The PDS4 Display namespace is used to define how an array-type 
    object with two or more dimensions should be displayed on, for example, 
    computer monitor or video screen.

    Figure showing the layout of a typical band sequential image. Often
    there may only be one band in an image or many more than 3 bands.
    For many images, a band defines a single wavelength or range of 
    wavelengths (of energy) as measured by an instrument or sensor. But a
    band can also hold a wide variety of measurements or caluclated derived
    values, for example, the phase or emission angle for each pixel in the 
    image or each pixel can represent a topopgraphic elevation (also called 
    digital elevation model, DEM or DTM). Setting band 1, 2, and 3
    respectively (or really any mixture of bands) to the red, blue, and 
    green (RGB) channels of a display will result in a color composite image.

The value of this attribute must match the value of one, and only one, axis_name attribute in an Axis_Array class of the associated Array. For many uses, the band axis will be defined here and will ultimately load three seperate bands into the red, green, and blue channels of the display device (also known as a color composite).

   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description            The time_display_axis attribute identifies, by name, the axis of an Array (or Array subclass), generally bands, of which are intended to be displayed sequentially in time on a display device. The frame_rate attribute, if present, provides the rate at which these frames (e.g., bands) are to be displayed.

   name                   frame_rate
   version                1.18
   value data type        ASCII_Real
   description            The frame_rate attribute indicates the number of still pictures (or frames) that should be displayed per unit of time in a video. Here we define the unit of time being frames per second (fps). Note this is NOT necessarily the same as the rate at which the images were acquired. Only positive values are legal. For context, video is primarily distributed in 24fps and 30fps frame rates.
   minimum value          1.E-307
   unit of measure type   Units_of_Frame_Rate

   name                   loop_flag

   value data type        ASCII_Integer
   description            The loop_count attribute specifies the number of times a movie should be "looped" or replayed before stopping. A loop_count of zero is allowed and defines an infinite loop, meaning the animation or movie should never stop looping.
   minimum value          0

   name                   loop_delay
   version                1.18

   value data type        ASCII_Boolean
   description            The loop_back_and_forth_flag attribute specifies whether or not a movie should only be "looped" or played repeatedly in the forward direction, or whether it should be played forward followed by played in reverse, iteratively.
